## About Mercedes-Benz

Mercedes-Benz is a German luxury and commercial vehicle automotive brand established in 1926. The company is known for pioneering innovations in automotive technology, safety features, and premium design throughout its long history.

## Generations

### Pre-War Era (1886-1945)

The origins of Mercedes-Benz date back to Karl Benz's Patent-Motorwagen of 1886, widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine automobile. In 1901, Emil Jellinek commissioned a car named after his daughter "Mercedes," establishing the brand name. The official Mercedes-Benz brand was formed in 1926 when Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft and Benz & Cie. merged. During this period, the company produced luxury vehicles like the 500K and 540K models.

### Post-War Reconstruction (1945-1960)

After World War II, Mercedes-Benz rebuilt its operations and returned to producing luxury vehicles. The iconic 300SL "Gullwing" was introduced in 1954, featuring distinctive upward-opening doors and becoming one of the most recognizable sports cars in automotive history. The company also expanded its lineup with models like the 180 and 190 sedans during this period.

### Modern Luxury Development (1960-1990)

This era saw Mercedes-Benz solidify its reputation for engineering excellence with models like the S-Class, which became the technological flagship of the brand. The company pioneered numerous safety innovations including crumple zones, airbags, and anti-lock braking systems. The 1960s and 1970s also saw the introduction of iconic models like the 600 "Grosser" and the R107 SL roadster.

### Global Expansion (1990-2010)

Mercedes-Benz expanded its product range significantly during this period, introducing the C-Class, E-Class, and M-Class (the company's first SUV). The brand also entered new market segments with the compact A-Class and formed the DaimlerChrysler corporation in 1998 (the partnership later dissolved in 2007). This era also saw increased focus on high-performance vehicles through the AMG division.

### Digital Transformation (2010-Present)

In recent years, Mercedes-Benz has focused on electrification, autonomous driving technology, and connectivity. The company launched its EQ sub-brand for electric vehicles, introduced MBUX (Mercedes-Benz User Experience) infotainment systems, and continued developing advanced driver assistance systems. Notable models from this era include the all-electric EQS sedan and various hybrid vehicles across the product range.
